# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Classification with Multiple ML Algorithms

This project explores the classic [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) using a variety of supervised learning algorithms. It walks through data loading, visualization, model evaluation, and final predictionâ€”all in a modular, beginner-friendly format.

## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Inside

### 1. **Data Preparation**
- Loads the Iris dataset using `pandas`
- Assigns column names for clarity
- Displays basic statistics and sample rows

### 2. **Visualization**
- Density plots for each feature
- Scatter matrix to explore feature relationships

### 3. **Model Evaluation**
- Splits data into training and validation sets (80/20)
- Tests six algorithms:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Linear Discriminant Analysis
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
  - Decision Tree
  - Naive Bayes
  - Support Vector Machine
- Uses 10-fold cross-validation to compare accuracy

### 4. **Final Model**
- Trains a KNN classifier on the training set
- Evaluates predictions on the validation set using:
  - Accuracy score
  - Confusion matrix
  - Classification report
